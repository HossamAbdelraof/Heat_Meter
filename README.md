# Heat_Meter
ECE project to measure surface tempeture and control a fan speed to cooldown the system

the full project based on many stages from measuring the tempereture to fan speed <br>
**all stages shoown in the diagram**

### <br>
> project roadmap  <br>


1- measure tempereture  <br>
2- maping the tempereture  <br>
3- read values with controoler  <br>
4- controol code the fan <br>
 <br>


## 1- sensing the tempereture:
> for sensing the temperetur ewe use IC  ***LM35***
